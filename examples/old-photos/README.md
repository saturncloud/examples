This example contains the supporting material for the [blog post](https://saturncloud.io/blog/bringing-old-photos-back-to-life/).

These notebooks use code from Microsoft Research's [Bringing Old Photos Back to Life](https://github.com/microsoft/Bringing-Old-Photos-Back-to-Life). 

The repository consists of two notebooks:

1. [Examples.ipynb](Examples.ipynb) A script to view the examples provided by the researchers and their results
2. [Upload-Your-Own-Pictures.ipynb](Upload-Your-Own-Pictures.ipynb) A script to upload your own photos
