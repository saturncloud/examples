A tree can be thought of as a collection of rules like `pickup_hour greater than 11` and `pickup_minute less than 31.0`. As you add more rules, those groups (called \"leaf nodes\") get smaller. In an extreme example, a model could create a tree with enough rules to place each record in the training data into its own group. That would probably take a lot of rules, and would be referred to as a \"deep\" tree.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Deep trees are problematic because their descriptions of the world are too specific to be useful on new data. Imagine training a classification model to predict whether or not visitors to a theme park will ride a particular rollercoaster. You could measure the time down to the millisecond that every guest's ticket is scanned at the entrance, and a model might learn a rule like *\"if the guest has been to the park before and if the guest is older than 40 and younger than 41, and if the guest is staying at Hotel A and if the guest enters the park after 1:00:17.456 and if the guest enters the park earlier than 1:00:17.995, they will ride the rollercoaster\"*. This is very very unlikely to ever match any future visitors, and if it does it's unlikely that this prediction will be very good unless you have some reason to believe that a visitor arriving at 1:00:18 instead of 1:00:17 really changes the probability that they'll ride that rollercoaster.\n",
    "    \n",
    "To prevent this situation (called \"overfitting\"), most tree-based machine learning algorithms accept parameters that control how deep the trees can get. `max_depth` is common, and says \"don't create a rule more complex than this\". In the example above, that rule has a depth of 7.\n",
