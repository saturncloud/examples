    "## Overview\n",
    "[Prefect Cloud](https://www.prefect.io/cloud/) is a hosted, high-availability, fault-tolerant service that handles all the orchestration responsibilities for running data pipelines. It gives you complete oversight of your workflows and makes it easy to manage them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example has the tasks run on a single machine, but allows the tasks to be able to run Dask commands themselves. This is appropriate for situations where each task can be parallelized within itself. If you want to do everything on a single machine without Dask, see [the single machine example](./01-prefect-singlenode.ipynb). If you want to have the set of tasks parallelized on the Dask cluster, see [prefect-daskclusters example](./02-prefect-daskclusters.ipynb).\n",

    "### Model Details\n",
    "For this example we will be using famous NYC taxi dataset. This dataset contains information about taxi trips in New York City. For the purposes of this example, we will be looking at the yellow taxi data from January 2019. We are distributing a single task amongst dask clusters. The task includes reading the datafrom nyc taxi dataset, filtering out the rows where price is missing and then calculating amount of variation in passenger count.  \n",

    "## Modelling Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "* created a Prefect Cloud account\n",
    "* set up the appropriate credentials in Saturn\n",
    "* set up a Prefect Cloud agent in Saturn Cloud\n",

    "### Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in this example uses prefect for orchestration (figuring out what to do, and in what order) and Dask Cluster for execution (doing the things).\n",
    "\n",
    "It relies on the following additional non-builtin libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [`dask-saturn`](https://github.com/saturncloud/dask-saturn): create and interact with Saturn Cloud `Dask` clusters\n",
    "* [`prefect-saturn`](https://github.com/saturncloud/prefect-saturn): register Prefect flows with both Prefect Cloud and  Saturn Cloud.\n"
