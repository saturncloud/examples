When building a tree, a set of possible \"split points\" (tuples of (feature, threshold)) is generated, and then each split point is evaluated. The one that leads to the best reduction in loss is chosen and added to the tree. Nodes are added to the tree this way until tree-specific stopping conditions are met. \n",
