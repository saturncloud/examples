    "Occasionally you might find yourself wanting to use Command Line Interface (CLI) tools in parallel. For instance, you may be working with a CLI tool for your specialized industry, and for an experiment you would like to execute the command many times at once across many machines. Dask is a great tool for scheduling these tasks and logging the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Dask for executing CLI tools, first ensure the tool of your choice is installed on the Saturn Cloud resource you're using. You can install software to a resource by using bash commands in the **Startup Script** of the resource options. This is stored in **Advanced Settings** and can be edited when you create the resource or by clicking the edit button of an existing resource.\n",

    "![Startup script options](https://saturn-public-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/example-resources/startup-script.png \"doc-image\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your resource is created (and you've [created a Dask cluster](https://saturncloud.io/docs/using-saturn-cloud/create_dask_cluster/) for it), you can then use Python code to execute the CLI tool on the Dask cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `subprocess.run` command in Python lets you execute command line tasks. To execute tasks in parallel you can wrap `subprocess.run()` within a function that you'll use on the Dask cluster. This will allow Dask to execute the command on a worker machine, allowing you to call it many times in parallel. You can do so using the [delayed](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/delayed.html) capabilities of Dask.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below uses the very basic `echo` CLI bash command to print a string showing some pairs of exponents. A list of inputs is executed in parallel on the Dask cluster using `dask.compute()`. The `echo` command prints the results to the output as a CLI command. In practice, you'll probably want to choose a more interesting CLI command besides `echo`.\n",
