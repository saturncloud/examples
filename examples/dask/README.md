# Working with Dask on Saturn Cloud

This resource lets you quickly get starting running computations across multiple systems using Dask. The resource is set up to have a single Jupyter Server resource and a Dask cluster with workers for distributed computations. To get started with Dask, check out the [`starting-dask.ipynb`](starting-dask.ipynb) notebook, which shows how you can take a parallelizable Python function and run it on multiple systems at once.

_For more details about the basics of Dask, read the [Parallelization in Python](https://saturncloud.io/docs/reference/dask_concepts/) article in the Saturn Cloud docs and the official [Dask documentation](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/).

This resource has multiple Dask example notebooks to show different Dask concepts:

* [`starting-dask.ipynb`](starting-dask.ipynb) - An introduction to using Dask on Saturn Cloud
* `dask-collections` - Details on particular Dask Collections
  * [`dask-dataframe.ipynb`](/dask-collections/dask-dataframe.ipynb)
  * [`dask-array.ipynb`](/dask-collections/dask-array.ipynb)
  * [`dask-bag.ipynb`](/dask-collections/dask-bag.ipynb)
* `dask-concurrency` - Using the different concurrency libraries in Dask
  * [`dask-delayed.ipynb`](/dask-concurrency/dask-delayed.ipynb)
  * [`dask-futures.ipynb`](/dask-concurrency/dask-future.ipynb)
* `machine-learning` - Machine learning methods for Dask
  * [`model-training.ipynb`](/machine-learning/model-training.ipynb)
  * [`grid-search.ipynb`](/machine-learning/grid-search.ipynb)
* `special-topics` - Other methods helpful for Dask
  * [`cli-calls.ipynb`](/special-topics/cli-calls.ipynb)
  * [`logging.ipynb`](/special-topics/logging.ipynb)
