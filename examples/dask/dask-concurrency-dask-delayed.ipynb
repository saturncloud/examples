    "In many situations you may want to directly run an algorithm on a distributed cluster rather than using a high-level library like Dask data collections. When you find yourself wanted to parallelize a particular algorithm or set of code, Dask Delayed can be a powerful tool. When using Dask Delayed you do not need to directly make any changes to your existing code. Instead, you'll take your existing functions and use those as the blocks that get run in parallel on the cluster. Dask will take the functions, built a task graph to determine how they should be run, then execute them in parallel.\n",

    "In the example below we have a formula one laptime dataset taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020?select=lap_times.csv). We will be finding range of lap time for a formula one driver. First we create a pandas DataFrame out of csv file and filter out data for driver ID 20. We then create and run three functions: finding maximum laptime, finding minimum laptime, and then getting the range out of it.\n",
