    "Dask Bags are used for taking a collection of Python objects and processing them in parallel. It can be thought as a sequence of objects that you can do parallel operations on over a distributed cluster. This is similar to the base Python operations like `map`, however the computations will happen in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Dask Bag is often a good solution for data that does not fit into a standard tabular or matrix format and thus wouldn't work with Dask DataFrames or Dask Arrays. For example, a list of nested JSON objects might not be able to easily be converted into a tabular format, but could be converted into a Dask Bag. You can do cleaning and data preprocessing of messy data with a Dask Bag and then at the end convert the data a Dask DataFrame to use in other methods like machine learning model training. "
