    "This example builds on [Single-Node Single GPU Training in TensorFlow](https://saturncloud.io/docs/examples/python/tensorflow/qs-single-gpu-tensorflow/). It trains a Resnet50 model on a dataset of bird images to identify different species of birds. In this example, we will be using multiple GPUs. We will parallelize the learning by using TensorFlow Mirrored Strategy. The model will split the data in each batch (sometimes called a \"global batch\") across the GPUs, thereby making \"worker batches.\" Each GPU has a copy of the model, called a \"replica,\" and after they learn on different parts of each batch, they will combine the learned gradients at the end of the step. The result at the end of training is one model that has learned on all the data.\n",

    "This dataset consists of 40,000+ images of birds and has been taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species).\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend spinning up a bigger Saturn Cloud instance now, with multiple GPUs, so we can distribute the training work and have the GPUs work simultaneously, all training the same model.\n"

    "Our dataset has already neatly separated training, test, and validation samples. In the code below, we construct Keras data objects for training and validation sets using `keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory`. We chose the Adam optimizer and set the learning rate to 0.02. We train our classifier with ResNet50 model architecture, which has 48 Convolution layers along with 1 MaxPool and 1 Average Pool layer. The model is compiled, trained, and saved in `model/keras_single/`. This function is actually incredibly similar than our single GPU approach. Weâ€™re simply applying the Mirrored Strategy scope around our model definition and compilation stage, so that TensorFlow knows this model is to be trained on multiple GPUs."
