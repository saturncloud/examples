# Start Using R in Saturn Cloud
## Welcome to Saturn Cloud!

This resource gives you an environment ready for conducting data science in R in Jupyter. Open a new notebook and select the R kernel to begin.

The following packages and all of their `Imports`, `Depends`, and `LinkingTo` dependencies are included in the image.

>To see the full list of installed packages, run the following in an R session in Jupyter.    
> `as.data.frame(installed.packages())[, c("Package", "Version")]`  
> You can install other libraries with `install.packages()`, `devtools`, or `remotes` according to your preference.

* caret
* data.table
* devtools
* dplyr
* ggplot2
* IRkernel
* keras
* lightgbm
* lubridate
* Rcpp
* readr
* remotes
* reticulate
* stringr
* tensorflow
* tidyr
* xgboost 

R is not compatible with Dask or Dask clusters, so you will not be able to take advantage of parallelization with Dask in R. However, we have provided the `reticulate` library, which can enable interaction between R and Python code.
