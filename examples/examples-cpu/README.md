# Saturn Cloud Examples (CPU)

Each folder corresponds to an example project that utilizes the tools within [Saturn Cloud](https://www.saturncloud.io/s/). These examples run on a Jupyter Server and/or Dask cluster with a **CPU** instance type and image.

Refer to the `README.md` file within each folder for detailed instructions on how to run them.

> **Pro tip**: Right-click on any `README.md` file and choose "Open With -> Markdown Preview" to view a rendered version

If you don't already use Saturn Cloud, [see how to get started here](https://www.saturncloud.io/docs/getting-started/)!

### Running in a new project

These examples are configured to run with small data sizes to quickly (and cost-effectively) illustrate the features of Saturn Cloud. If you prefer to run these examples in a new project, or would like to modify the code and run with larger data sizes and clusters, you can clone the repo by opening a new Terminal within the JupyterLab of your project, then copying the example you want into the `/home/jovyan/project` folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saturncloud/examples.git /tmp/examples
cp -r /tmp/examples/examples/examples-cpu /home/jovyan/project/
```

## NYC Taxi

An end-to-end data science pipeline comprising data ingest, exploratory analysis, machine learning model training, and deploying models and a dashboard.

*You will learn:*
- How to get performance speedups for ML model training with Dask
- How to deploy a dashboard
