We chose the Adam optimizer and set the learning rate to 0.02. We train our classifier using the ResNet50 architecture, which has 48 Convolution layers along with 1 MaxPool and 1 Average Pool layer. It learns from each image, updates the model gradients, and gradually improves its performance. The model is compiled, trained, and saved in `model/keras_single/`."
