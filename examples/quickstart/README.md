# Saturn Cloud quickstart project

This project helps you run your code as quickly as possible. It provides a blank canvas for you to put your code in and run--just upload scripts and notebooks to JupyterLab and run them.

* Not sure what you want to do with Saturn? Instead of this project start up one of the pre-made [example projects](https://www.saturncloud.io/docs/getting-started/start_project/) that demo the capabilities of Saturn Cloud.
* If you won't be needing a GPU, you can optionally stop this project and [create custom project](https://www.saturncloud.io/docs/getting-started/start_project/) that has only a CPU._
* If you would like to use Dask, go to the [project page of the Saturn UI](https://www.saturncloud.io/docs/getting-started/create_cluster_ui/) and start the Dask cluster.
