# Image Classification with Pytorch and Saturn Cloud


The notebooks in this example showcase data science workflows with [the Stanford Dogs dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/), executed on [Saturn Cloud](https://www.saturncloud.io/). 

These examples are meant to demonstrate how workflows using deep learning, particularly computer vision problems with Pytorch, can be run on Saturn Cloud with GPU instances to dramatically increase the productivity and speed of data science efforts.

If you care to run these examples yourself, we recommend taking advantage of the [Saturn Cloud free trial](https://www.saturncloud.io/s/)!

The notebooks in _this_ example cover:

1. Run inference to classify images with a pre-build deep learning model
1. COMING SOON: Run a transfer learning workflow to build upon an existing model 

You are free to open each notebook in this example and start playing around! We have included detailed instructions in the notebooks, but if you have any questions we are happy to help.  

If you have any issues with Saturn Cloud, please email us at support@saturncloud.io. If you notice any mistakes in these notebooks or documentation, [open an issue](https://github.com/saturncloud/examples/issues) or a [a pull request](https://github.com/saturncloud/examples/pulls).
