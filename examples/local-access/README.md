## Use Cluster from Local Environment Quickstart

In this project, you'll learn how to create and interact with a Dask cluster from your local environment using the Saturn Cloud service. This allows you to skip interacting with the Saturn Cloud UI almost entirely, if you want to.

* [Set Up Connection](setup-external-connection.ipynb)  
This notebook gives the step by step instructions for connecting your local coding environment to Saturn Cloud cluster resources. Complete this before doing the following examples.

* [Analyzing Data Example (Dask)](analyze-data.ipynb)  
This notebook demonstrates a data analysis workflow on a cluster, run from your local environment.

* [Model Training Example (PyTorch and Dask)](train-pytorch-cluster.ipynb)  
In this notebook, we use the Saturn Cloud cluster to run a parallel training task with PyTorch.
