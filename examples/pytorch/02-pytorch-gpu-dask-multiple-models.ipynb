    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to train multiple neural networks in parallel using Dask. This is valuable for situations such as when you want to compare different parameters for a model to see which performs better. By having a cluster of machines each training a model, you can train all of the models more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example builds on the [introduction to PyTorch with GPU on Saturn Cloud](./01-pytorch-gpu.ipynb) example that trains a neural network to generate pet names, but instead of training the model once it trains it several times with different parameters and compares the results. Rather than having to wait for each of the different set of parameters to train sequentially, it uses the Dask cluster to train them all concurrently, dramatically speeding up the process. The code to set up the data and model architecture is the same as the original getting started with PyTorch example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses LSTM layers which are especially good at discovering patterns in sequences like text. The model takes a partially complete name and determines the probability of each possible next character in the name. Characters are randomly sampled from this distribution and added to the partial name until a stop character is generated and full name has been created. For more detail about the network design and use case, see our [Saturn Cloud blog post](https://saturncloud.io/blog/dask-with-gpus/) which uses the same network architecture.\n",
