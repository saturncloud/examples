# Train an TensorFlow model with R on a GPU

This example uses the reticulate, Keras, and TensorFlow packages of R to train a model on a GPU.
To run it, use the `saturn-rstudio-tensorflow` image.

If you would rather train it on a CPU you can instead use the `saturn-rstudio` image. You will need to manually install the R and Python libraries for both Keras and TensorFlow in the start script.
