    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), in addition to its competitions and other offerings, has an expansive offering of curated and community submitted datasets. The datasets span numerous domains, sizes, and file types. This tutorial will give you the foundational information to load data from Kaggle directly into Saturn Cloud, quickly and easily!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process\n",
    "### Create Kaggle Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step for accessing data from Kaggle is to create an API token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access the account page of your Kaggle account by signing in and clicking on your username and picture in the top right. Click on the **Account** tab:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Kaggle account menu with arrow pointing to the Account tab](https://saturn-public-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/example-resources/kaggle-account-header-arrow.jpeg \"doc-image\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Then scroll down to the API section, and click **Create New API Token**:\n",

    "\n",
    "This will download a file named “kaggle.json.” This file contains your username and API key. Save it in a safe place!\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the “kaggle.json” file in your favorite text editor, and you will see your Kaggle username and key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add Kaggle Credentials to Saturn Cloud\n",
    "Sign in to your Saturn Cloud account and select **Credentials** from the menu on the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://saturn-public-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/example-resources/saturn-credentials-arrow.jpeg\" style=\"width:200px;\" alt=\"Saturn Cloud left menu with arrow pointing to Credentials tab\" class = \"doc-image\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you will add your Kaggle API key information. *This is a secure storage location, and it will not be available to the public or other users without your consent.*\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top right corner of this page, you will find the **New** button. Click here, and you will be taken to the Credentials Creation form. \n",

    "\n",
    "|  Credential | Type  | Name| Variable Name  | Value  | \n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Kaggle Username  |  Environment Variable | `kaggle-username`  | `KAGGLE_USERNAME`  | `<your username>`\n",
    "| Kaggle API Key  |  Environment Variable | `kaggle-api-key`  | `KAGGLE_KEY`  | `<your key>`\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the values (without quotes) from your “kaggle.json” file into the **Value** section of the credential creation form. The credential names are recommendations; feel free to change them as needed for your workflow. You must, however, use the provided **Variable Names** for Kaggle to connect correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this complete, your Kaggle credentials will be accessible by Saturn Cloud resources!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download a Dataset\n",
    "Now that you have set up the credentials for Kaggle properly, downloading Kaggle data is really straightforward! \n",
    "\n",
    "In Kaggle, find the dataset you want to download. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the dataset page, click on the three dots to the right and select **Copy API Command**.\n",
