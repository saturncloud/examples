    "# Overview\n",
    "<a href=\"https://www.snowflake.com/\" target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Snowflake</a> is a data platform built for the cloud that allows for fast SQL queries. This example shows how to query data in Snowflake and pull into Saturn Cloud for data science work. We will rely on the <a href=\"https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/python-connector.html\" target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Snowflake Connector for Python</a> to connect and issue queries from Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The images that come with Saturn come with the Snowflake Connector for Python installed. If you are building your own images and want to work with Snowflake, you should include `snowflake-connector-python` in your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this, you should create a Jupyter server resource and start it. See our [quickstart](https://saturncloud.io/docs/start_in_ten/) if you don't know how to do this yet.\n",

    "\n",
    "With this complete, your Snowflake credentials will be accessible by Saturn Cloud resources! You will need to restart any Jupyter Server or Dask Clusters for the credentials to populate to those resources.\n",

    "\n",
    "From a notebook where you want to connect to Snowflake, you can use the credentials as environment variables and provide any additional arguments, if necessary."
