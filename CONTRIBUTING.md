# Making changes to this repo <a name="changes"></a>

All changes to this repository are required to go through pull requests. Create a new branch, commit your changes, and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/saturncloud/examples/compare).

When your pull request is opened, a set of automated checks will run to check that your code conforms with the structure described in ["`examples/` Directory Structure"](#dir-structure).

# Adding a new example <a name="new-example"></a>

When you add a new example, add an entry to [`CODEOWNERS`](./.github/CODEOWNERS) to be sure you'll be added as a reviewer on future updates to it.

## `examples/` Directory Structure <a name="dir-structure"></a>

Examples in the `examples/` directory follow a specific directory structure so that they can be cloned into Saturn from recipes.

Each directory below `examples/` corresponds to one potential resource that users can clone either from the recipe directly, or from a corresponding  resource template.

```text

```

NOTE: this is part of the output from `tree -a examples/`.

To test if you've added a new example correctly, run the following from the root of this repo:

```shell
make install test validate
```

If this raises any issues, try automatically fixing them

```shell
make format
```

# Updating examples

The goal is that the you should be able to push changes to main and see those changes as quickly as possible on Saturn without breaking anything that already exists.

To support that goal, there should be only one branch of this repo for every recipe schema version.

## Use new versions of images (common)

After new images are created:

1. Create a pull request into `main` which updates all of the `"image_uri"` entries in `saturn.json` files to the latest images released from https://github.com/saturncloud/images.
2. Run integration tests using that branch.
3. Merge the pull request.
4. Ask someone on the devops team to update the examples one of the staging instances.
5. Manually test any examples that you are worried about.
6. Once you are satisfied, ask someone on the devops team to update the images on hosted.

NOTE: In the future we expect to add a separate mechanism for updating the images separate from the update examples mechanism. Once this is established you will be able to ask someone to update the images on a staging instance then you will be able to test the example using a recipe _before_ merging the PR.

## Use new version of the recipe schema (rare)

Anytime _after_ a new release makes it to [hosted](https://app.community.saturnenterprise.io), you can start using the latest recipe schema that is supported by that release. Note that the only reason to do this is if you want to take advantage of some new feature in the latest recipe schema.

First create a new branch from `main`. Its name must start with `release-`.

```shell
git pull origin main
git checkout -b release-2022.03.01
git push release-2022.03.01
```

Remember: the Saturn version on hosted should already be 2022.04.01 _before_ you create that branch.

Once you have created a release branch for the old examples, you can start using the new recipe schema on `main`

1. Update [RECIPE_SCHEMA_VERSION](https://github.com/saturncloud/examples/blob/main/RECIPE_SCHEMA_VERSION) to the version on [hosted](https://app.community.saturnenterprise.io).
2. Update all the `schema_version` fields in all the recipes and make any changes.
3. Update the button on [README.md](https://github.com/saturncloud/examples/blob/main/README.md) to point to the new RECIPE_SCHEMA_VERSION
4. Create a pull request with these changes with `main` as the base.
5. Run integration tests on that branch to make sure that things work.

After the PR merges, tell someone on the engineering team that you are changing the `schema_version` for examples, and they will change `EXAMPLES_RECIPE_SCHEMA_VERSION` to match and run `make examples`.

# Frequently Asked Questions <a name="faq"></a>

#### Can I include other code or add more sub-directories under and example in the `examples/` directory?

All other directories included under the example directory will be included in the example, and an arbitrary amount of nesting is permitted. Non-code files such as data should be stored on S3.

#### What do I do if my example needs a custom image?

All images referenced in an example's `.saturn/saturn.json` should be publicly available on Docker Hub. This repository does not handle building new images.

If you need a new image, you can make a pull request in https://github.com/saturncloud/images to add it.

#### Why does this repository use long-lived release branches instead of GitHub releases and tags on `main`?

Using long-lived release branches allows for the possibility of hot-fixing older versions of this repository if issues arise.
